    "\n",
    "There are different types of traps:\n",
    "- **System calls** (intentional traps caused by user programs).\n",
    "- **Hardware interrupts** (e.g., I/O completion).\n",
    "- **Faults** (e.g., page faults).\n",

    "- The **current processor flags/status register** ‚Äî including mode bits (user/kernel).\n",
    "- Possibly other registers depending on architecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is usually pushed onto the **kernel stack**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ‚úÖ b. Switch to kernel mode\n",

    "\n",
    "### ‚úÖ c. Look up the **trap handler address**\n",
    "Now here's the key part:  \n",
    "> The CPU needs to figure out where in memory to jump to execute the OS trap handler.\n",
    "\n",

    "#### üß© The IDT ‚Äì Interrupt Descriptor Table\n",

    "- The **address of the handler function** (where the CPU should jump).\n",
    "- Segment selector (GDT segment).\n",

    "For example, on Linux/x86, the system call trap might be mapped to vector number `0x80` (legacy) or via the `syscall` instruction (modern).\n",
    "\n",
    "The OS sets up the IDT so that when a system call occurs, the CPU knows to jump to a specific function like `system_call()` or `do_syscall_64()` in the Linux kernel source.\n",

    "#### üß† How the CPU Uses the IDT:\n",

    "5. CPU jumps to that address ‚Äî now executing in kernel mode.\n",
