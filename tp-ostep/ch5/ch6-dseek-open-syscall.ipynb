    "### **1. User Application Requests a Syscall (e.g., `open()`)**  \n",
    "#### **Is the Application \"Receiving\" an Interrupt?**  \n",
    "No! The application **triggers** a software interrupt (or uses a dedicated syscall instruction) to *request* kernel services. It’s not \"receiving\" an interrupt—the CPU is.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### **What Actually Happens?**  \n",
    "- The app calls `open()` (a libc wrapper).  \n",
    "- Libc prepares arguments (e.g., filename, flags) and executes a **syscall instruction** (e.g., `syscall` on x86-64, `int 0x80` on older x86).  \n",
    "- This instruction **forces a controlled trap** into the kernel.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Does the OS Check Authority First?**  \n",
    "Not yet! The CPU first handles the trap mechanically. The OS checks permissions *after* the trap is taken.  \n",
    "- The CPU switches to kernel mode and jumps to the syscall handler (via the trap table).  \n",
    "- **Then**, the OS checks:  \n",
    "  - Does the process have permission to open this file?  \n",
    "  - Is the filename valid?  \n",

    "### **2. CPU Saves State: How the Kernel Stack Works**  \n",
    "#### **What is the Kernel Stack?**  \n",
    "- Each process has **two stacks**:  \n",
    "  1. **User stack**: For normal function calls in user mode.  \n",
    "  2. **Kernel stack**: A small memory region (typically 8–16 KB) in kernel memory, used *only* when the process is in kernel mode (e.g., during syscalls).  \n",
    "- The kernel stack is **per-thread** and lives in kernel address space (inaccessible to user code).  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Who Saves State? The CPU or the OS?**  \n",
    "- **The CPU does this automatically** when a trap occurs! Here’s how:  \n",
    "  1. The CPU detects the `syscall` instruction.  \n",
    "  2. It **switches to the kernel stack** (how? The OS configured this at boot via the **Task State Segment (TSS)** on x86, which holds the kernel stack pointer for each process).  \n",
    "  3. It **pushes user-mode registers** onto the kernel stack:  \n",
    "     - Instruction pointer (`RIP`).  \n",
    "     - Stack pointer (`RSP`).  \n",
    "     - Flags register (`RFLAGS`).  \n",
    "     - Others (architecture-dependent).  \n",
    "  4. The CPU **jumps to the syscall handler** (from the trap table).  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### **How Does the CPU \"Push\" to the Kernel Stack?**  \n",
    "- The CPU has hardware support for this. When the privilege level changes (user → kernel), it:  \n",
    "  - Loads the kernel stack pointer from the TSS.  \n",
    "  - Uses the `%rsp` register to **physically write** the saved state to kernel memory.  \n",
    "  - No software (OS) intervention is needed yet—this is all hardware magic.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### **After the Trap: The OS Takes Over**  \n",
    "- The OS’s syscall handler now runs, using the kernel stack for its own function calls.  \n",
    "- It checks permissions, performs the file open, etc.  \n",
    "- To return, the OS executes `iret` (interrupt return), which:  \n",
    "  - Pops the saved registers from the kernel stack.  \n",
    "  - Switches back to the user stack.  \n",
    "  - Returns to user mode.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Key Takeaways**  \n",
    "1. **Syscalls are traps triggered by software** (not \"received\").  \n",
    "2. **CPU saves state automatically** by pushing registers to the kernel stack (per-thread, in kernel memory).  \n",
    "3. **Kernel stack is set up by the OS** (via TSS on x86) but managed by the CPU during traps.  \n",
    "4. **Permission checks happen in kernel mode**, after the trap is taken.  \n",

    "2. CPU:  \n",
    "   - Switches to kernel stack (from TSS).  \n",
    "   - Saves `RIP`, `CS`, `RFLAGS`, `RSP`, `SS` on kernel stack.  \n",
    "   - Jumps to `entry_SYSCALL_64` (Linux’s syscall handler).  \n",
    "3. Linux checks permissions, does file I/O.  \n",
    "4. Linux calls `iretq` to return to user mode.  \n",

    "2. The **size (limit)** of the table.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The OS must **load** (i.e., write) these values into the IDTR at boot time, so the CPU knows where to find the trap handlers.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **How the OS Loads the IDTR: Step by Step**\n",
    "#### **1. The OS Builds the Trap Table in Memory**  \n",

    "- The **address of a handler function** (e.g., `divide_error_handler`, `syscall_handler`).  \n",

    "struct idt_entry idt[256];  // Trap table with 256 entries\n",
    "```\n",

    "#### **2. The OS Uses the `LIDT` Instruction to Load the IDTR**  \n",
    "The kernel executes a **privileged instruction** (`LIDT`) to tell the CPU where the IDT is.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In x86 assembly:\n",

    "idt_descriptor:\n",

    "; Load the IDTR with LIDT\n",
    "lidt [idt_descriptor]       ; CPU now knows where the trap table is!\n",

    "\n",
    "### 1. **What is the Trap Table?**\n",
    "- The **trap table** (also called an **interrupt descriptor table (IDT)** or **syscall table** in some systems) is a **data structure in kernel memory** that the OS sets up at boot time.  \n",
    "- It’s essentially an **array of function pointers**, where each entry points to a specific **OS handler routine** for a particular trap or interrupt.  \n",
    "- Example entries:  \n",
    "  - System call handler (e.g., for `read`, `write`).  \n",

    "  - Exception handlers (e.g., divide-by-zero errors).  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **How Does the CPU Know Where the Trap Table Is?**\n",

    "When a user program executes a system call (e.g., `read()`), here’s the detailed flow:  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 1: User Program Triggers a Trap\n",
    "- The program calls `read()`, which is a wrapper for a **system call instruction** (e.g., `syscall` on x86-64, `int 0x80` on older x86).  \n",
    "- This instruction is the **trap instruction**—it’s like raising your hand to ask the OS for help.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 2: CPU Looks Up the Trap Table\n",
    "- The CPU checks its **trap table register** to find the table’s location in memory.  \n",
    "- It indexes the table using a **trap number** (e.g., `0x80` for Linux syscalls on x86). Each trap number corresponds to a specific OS handler.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 3: CPU Jumps to the Handler\n",
    "- The trap table entry contains:  \n",
    "  - The **address of the OS handler** (e.g., the `sys_read` function for file I/O).  \n",
    "  - The **privilege level** (kernel mode).  \n",
    "- The CPU:  \n",
    "  - Switches to kernel mode.  \n",
    "  - Saves the user program’s registers (to restore later).  \n",
    "  - Jumps to the handler address **specified in the trap table**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 4: OS Handles the Request\n",
    "- The OS runs the handler (e.g., `sys_read` fetches data from disk).  \n",
    "- When done, it executes **return-from-trap** (e.g., `iret` on x86), which:  \n",
    "  - Restores registers.  \n",

    "  - Returns control to the instruction **after** the trap.  \n",

    "### 4. **Trap Table vs. Trap Handler**\n",
    "- **Trap table**: The \"directory\" (array of pointers) in kernel memory.  \n",
    "- **Trap handler**: The actual OS code (e.g., `sys_read`) that the table points to.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Analogy:  \n",
    "Think of the trap table as a **fire alarm panel** in a building:  \n",
    "- Each alarm pull station (trap number) is linked to a specific response (handler).  \n",
    "- When you pull the alarm (execute `syscall`), the system checks the panel (trap table) and dispatches firefighters (OS handler).  \n",
